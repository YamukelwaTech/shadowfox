# Task 1
# Explanation: Assigns the value 227 to the variable pi and prints its type and checks if it is an instance of the integer class.
pi = 227
print(type(pi))
print(isinstance(pi, int))

# Task 2
# Explanation: Demonstrates the use of a reserved keyword 'for' in Python which results in a syntax error.
# This code is commented out to prevent syntax errors.
# for = 4

# Task 3
# Explanation: Calculates simple interest using the provided principal amount, interest rate, and time period.
principal_amount = 4587
interest = 5
time = 3

P = principal_amount
R = interest
T = time

simple_interest = (P * R * T) / 100
print(simple_interest)
