"""
Summary:
This Python script includes functions to simulate rolling dice and performing jumping jacks. It also incorporates logic to track occurrences of specific outcomes during dice rolls and manage a jumping jack workout session.

Objective:
The objective of this script is to provide functionality for simulating dice rolls, tracking occurrences of specific outcomes, and managing a jumping jack workout session with user interaction.
