"""
Summary:
This Python script defines functions and demonstrates error handling, calculations, and function calls related to different scenarios.

Objective:
The objective of this script is to showcase how to define functions, handle errors, perform calculations, and use functions to obtain results related to area, speed, and representation of numbers.

"""


# Task 1
# Explanation: Defines a function 'representation' that takes two arguments, num and char. It checks if num is an integer, if not, it returns an error message. Then, it constructs and returns a string containing the number and the character.
def representation(num, char):
    # Check if num is a valid integer
    if not isinstance(num, int):
        return "Invalid input for num: '{}' is not an integer".format(num)
    string = "Number: {:d}, letter: '{}'".format(num, char)
    return string


answers = representation(45, "o")
print(answers)


# Task 2
# Explanation: Defines a function 'area' that calculates the area of a circle given the radius and pi value. It then calculates the area of a pond using the 'area' function and computes the total water in the pond based on the given square meter value.
def area(radius, pi):
    calculation = pi * (radius**2)
    return calculation


pi = 3.14
result = area(10, pi)
print("Area of the pond is ", int(result), "meters")

square_meter = 1.4
total_water = result * square_meter
print("Total water of the pond is ", int(total_water), "meters")


# Task 3
# Explanation: Defines a function 'my_speed' that calculates speed given distance and time. It calculates the speed and prints the result.
def my_speed(distance, time):
    speed = distance / time
    return speed


answer = my_speed(490, 7)
print("My speed is ", int(answer), "meters per second")
